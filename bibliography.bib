            This paper describes an intelligent adaptive PID controller design procedure. The controller consists of a discrete time PID and an auto-tuning neural network unit. First system identification with a nonlinear autoregressive model (NARX) was performed. This model was then used to train the neural PID tuner. A special MATLAB toolbox “SmatPID Toolbox” was developed to automate the process of controller synthesis. The resulting controller was tested in a laboratory coal-gas furnace control system to track specified air flow rates.},

	abstract = {Electric direct-current (DC) drives based on DC motor are extremely important in the manufacturing process, so it must be crucial to increase their performance when they are working on load disturbances or the DC motor’s parameters change. Usually, several load torque suddenly appears when electric drives are operating in a speed closed-loop, so robust controllers are required to keep the speed high-performance. One of the most well-known robust strategies is the sliding mode controller (SMC), which works under discontinue operation. This controller can handle disturbances and variations in the plant’s parameters, so the controller has robust performance. Nevertheless, it has some disadvantages (chattering). Therefore, this paper proposed a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that includes an artificial organic network for adjusting the command signal of the SMC. The proposed controller gives a smooth signal that decrements the chattering in the SMC. The stability condition that is based on Lyapunov of the DC motor is driven is evaluated; besides, the stability margins are calculated. The proposed controller is designed using co-simulation and a real testbed since co-simulation is an extremely useful tool in academia and industry allows to move from co-simulation to real implementation in short period of time. Moreover, there are several universities and industries that adopt co-simulation as the main step to design prototypes. Thus, engineering students and designers are able to achieve excellent results when they design rapid and functional prototypes. For instance, co-simulation based on Multisim leads to design directly printed circuit boards so engineering students or designers could swiftly get an experimental DC drive. The experimental results using this platform show excellent DC-drive performance when the load torque disturbances are suddenly applied to the system. As a result, the proposed controller based on fuzzy artificial organic and SMC allows for adjusting the command signal that improves the dynamic response in DC drives. The experimental response using the sliding-mode controller with fuzzy artificial organic networks is compared against an auto-tuning, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), which is a conventional controller. The PID controller is the most implemented controller in several industries, so this proposal can contribute to improving manufacturing applications, such as micro-computer numerical control (CNC) machines. Moreover, the proposed robust controller achieves a superior-speed response under the whole tested scenarios. Finally, the presented design methodology based on co-simulation could be used by universities and industry for validating and implementing advanced control systems in DC drives.},

	abstract = {De acuerdo a diversos reportes, se estima que alrededor del 70\% de los lazos de control industrial utilizan los clásicos algoritmos de control PID (Proporcional Integral Derivativo), el más utilizado de ellos es el PID Paralelo, pero existen variantes tales como los PID seriales, I-PD y PI-D, cada uno de ellos posee diferentes propiedades. En este estudio se evalúa el desempeño de estas diversas implementaciones en una planta de control angular que consta de un brazo manipulado por un motor Brushless. Para el control angular del brazo, se ensayaron las diversas implementaciones de controladores PID reportados en la literatura, obteniendo el valor de sus parámetros en función del modelo de la planta. Para lograr diseñar los algoritmos fue necesario discretizar las ecuaciones diferenciales que definen a los controladores PID, transformando sus ecuaciones diferenciales a ecuaciones de diferencias las que posteriormente se programaron en C++. En una primera instancia los esquemas de control se implementaron en modo simulación para posteriormente implementarlos en tiempo real. Los resultados logrados fueron bastante similares y la posterior evaluación de las diversas implementaciones ensayadas demostró que el algoritmo PID paralelo cumplió más eficazmente los objetivos de control.
Resumen alternativo:
According to various reports, it is estimated that around 70\% of industrial control loops use the classical PID control algorithms (Proportional Integral Derivative), the most used of them is the Parallel PID, but there are variants such as serial PID, I-PD and PI-D, each of them has different properties. In this study, the performance of these diverse implementations is evaluated in an angular control plant that consists of an arm manipulated by a Brushless motor. For the angular control of the arm, the various implementations of PID controllers reported in the literature were tested, obtaining the value of their parameters according to the model of the plant. In order to design the algorithms it was necessary to discretize the differential equations that define the PID controllers, transforming their differential equations to equations of differences which were later programmed in C ++. In a first instance, the control schemes were implemented in simulation mode to subsequently implement them in real time. The results obtained were quite similar and the subsequent evaluation of the various implementations tested showed that the parallel PID algorithm fulfilled the control objectives more effectively.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy Logic is a investigative control system method that contributes to performance in systems. It covers almost every electronic circuit, very large computer networks, process automation to household gadgets. It can be used very effectively to develop a better hardware and software combination. Fuzzy logic provides us the flexibility to jump to an unambiguous result to a blurred input. Its approach enables us to emboss human like thinking which is in certain cases based upon a blurred input; onto a machine. While designing a control system, controller selection and tuning of its parameters must be taken into account. Because of Fuzzy PID control it is now possible to design a control system which is capable of taking decisions faster and certain based on blurred input, just like Humans. In this Paper, a comparison of fuzzy PID controller and Conventional PID controller is done for the most complete case of Robotic Applications. The Fuzzy-PID performance is summarized in terms of its input and output variables, which allows us to analyse the Fuzzy-PID response and to compare it with the Conventional PID. The tuning has been tested using Matlab Simulation.},
